# Defensive-Security-Solution

Throughout the project, you will work in teams to build a defensive security solution for a mock organization. You'll begin by analyzing both normal and malicious log data from Windows and Apache systems to understand the environment and identify threats. Using Splunk, you'll create baselines, then design custom alerts, reports, and dashboards to monitor for suspicious activity.

You'll also install a Splunk add-on of your choice to enhance monitoring capabilities against specific attacks.

As part of the analysis, you'll:

Load and analyze Windows and Apache logs, including attack data

Answer review questions based on your findings

Evaluate whether your defenses detect adversary attacks from JobeCorp

Collaborate with your group to refine your monitoring solutions

Prepare and deliver a project presentation summarizing your work and findings from Days 1 and 2
